The FTP server of NCBI Taxonomy contains a tree of life of very many species and other 'taxa'.
The following command downloads a database dump, extracts from the archive the file nodes.dmp which contains a table of tree nodes, extracts the first 2 columns from this table and creates another, tab-separated table from them.

wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz -O - | tar zf - --get nodes.dmp -O | perl -pe 's/(\d+)\t\|\t(\d+).*/$1\t$2/' > taxonomy.tree

Here, each number identifies a node. The node identified by 1 is the root of the tree of life.
Each row specifies an edge in the tree: If x and y are the two numbers in a row then there is an edge from node y to node x. The set of numbers in the second column is a subset of the set of numbers in the first column.

Task:
1) Write a program that finds for a tree in the given input format a deepest node.
The depth of a node u is the number of edges on the path from the root to u.

2) Apply your program to taxonomy.tree and output a deepest node as well as its depth.
