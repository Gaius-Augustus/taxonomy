## Search literature relevant to the following questions:
 - relate the distances (phylogenetic or % difference) of nuclear genomes with taxonomic units
 - How far to another sequenced genome is a given genome?
 - Distances in regions of nuclear genome that is not functional, e.g. introns of orthologous genes.
 - Definition of taxonomic units (e.g. family, order). Any relationship to genetic distance?
 - Papers that use NCBI taxonomy in a systematic or automatic way.
